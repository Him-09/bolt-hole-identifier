# Bolt Hole Number Recognition Project Report

## Project Overview
This report documents the development and evaluation of a deep learning model designed to recognize numbers in the bolt holes on the hub surface, including the ability to detect when no number is present. The project demonstrates excellent results with 100% accuracy on both regular number recognition and no-number detection.

## 1. Project Architecture

### 1.1 Model Architecture (MyModel)
- **Input Layer**: Accepts grayscale images (1 channel) of size 64x64
- **Convolutional Layers**:
  - Conv1: 1 → 64 channels, 3x3 kernel with padding
  - Conv2: 64 → 128 channels, 3x3 kernel with padding
  - Conv3: 128 → 128 channels, 3x3 kernel with padding
- **Additional Features**:
  - Batch Normalization after each conv layer
  - MaxPooling (2x2) for dimension reduction
  - Dropout layers (25% and 50%) for regularization
- **Fully Connected Layers**:
  - FC1: 128 * 8 * 8 → 512 neurons
  - FC2: 512 → 101 neurons (100 numbers + 1 no-number class)

- **Image Preprocessing**:
  - Conversion to grayscale
  - Resizing to 64x64 pixels
