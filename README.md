# License Plate Number Recognition Model

A deep learning model for recognizing numbers in license plate images, with special handling for cases where no number is present.

## Features

- High accuracy in recognizing numbers (00-99)
- Special handling for no-number cases
- Data augmentation for improved generalization
- Early stopping and learning rate scheduling
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics

## Performance Metrics

- Regular Number Accuracy: 100%
- No-Number Detection Accuracy: 95.24%
- Fast convergence (high accuracy achieved within 10-15 epochs)
- Stable training with minimal overfitting
